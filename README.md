# crystalAligner
crystalAligner is a computer program for alignment of crystals in a scanning electron microscope. Given one or two crystal orientations (obtained from i.e. EBSD), one or two crystal directions and associated axes of the microscope coordinate system as alignment objectives, the program optimizes the alignment of the crystal(s) with the microscope coordinate system by global optimization under the constraints of available rotational axes and limits of the microscope stage. 

**crystalAligner** uses [**MATLAB**](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and the **MATLAB**-based crystallographic toolbox [**MTEX**](https://mtex-toolbox.github.io) under the hood and it therefore utilize crystal symmetries. Furthermore, the determination of the best stage rotation angles is realized with a [**heuristic optimization algorithm**](https://mathworks.com/discovery/genetic-algorithm.html) which is robust in finding the global optimum. The crystal alignment can therefore often be optimized to a satisfactory degree even in the case of a standard microscope stage with two rotation axes. 

A scientific treatment of the crystallographic aspects and the optimization procedure can be found in the associated [*research paper*](./doc/crystalAligner_researchPaper_2020.pdf). If you like **crystalAligner** and apply it for your research I would appreciate a citation.
